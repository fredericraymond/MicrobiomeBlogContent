This article reviews the difficulties in colonizing the microbiome by pathogens. They mention different ways the commensal flora impedes colonization such as :
1. Production of bacteriocins or antibiotics by commensals
2. Production of SCFAs or secondary bile acids 
3. Competion for nutrients
4. Inflammation may favor pathogen colonization.
Although they mention probiotics, the focus of the paper is on pathogens.

> Reports from germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice may suggest a more passive form of colonization resistance in which antibiotics, rather than diminishing the presence of actively protective commensals, could be disrupting the microbial ecosystem in a manner that pathogens are able to exploit
