This article reviews the difficulties in colonizing the microbiome by pathogens. They mention different ways the commensal flora impedes colonization such as :
1. Production of bacteriocins or antibiotics by commensals
2. Production of SCFAs or secondary bile acids 
3. Competion for nutrients
4. Inflammation may favor pathogen colonization.
Although they mention probiotics, the focus of the paper is on pathogens.

> Reports from germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice may suggest a more passive form of colonization resistance in which antibiotics, rather than diminishing the presence of actively protective commensals, could be disrupting the microbial ecosystem in a manner that pathogens are able to exploit

## The microbiome and food

### Engineered commensal microbes for diet-mediated colorectal-cancer chemoprevention

The authors describe how they engineered a commensal Escherichia coli to process molecules from brocoli and transform it into a cancer inhibiting molecule. [The paper is well explained this Science Translational medecine article] (http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/428/eaar7534.full) 

> The engineered commensal Escherichia coli bound specifically to the heparan sulphate proteoglycan on colorectal cancer cells and secreted the enzyme myrosinase to transform host-ingested glucosinolates—natural components of cruciferous vegetables—to sulphoraphane, an organic small molecule with known anticancer activity. The engineered microbes coupled with glucosinolates resulted in >95% proliferation inhibition of murine, human and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro.
