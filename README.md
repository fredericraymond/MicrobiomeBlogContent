## Welcome to the website of Frédéric Raymond, associate professor at Université Laval

Millions of bacteria live within our body. Their presence is essential for our well being as they help digest food ans contribute to immunity. Still, some of them can affect how we process drugs or nutrients. It all depends on the composition of our microbiome. The goal of my lab is to understand the impact of these bacteria on human health, both in term of microbioal communities and of the precise genotypes of these bugs.
